    "In this strategy using two Exponential Moving Average lines with fast period of 10 and slow period of 50 (following the prior first experiment), we obtained a final value of \\$12942.65, \\$2941.34 dollar more than that of the original Double SMA Crossover strategy ($10001.31). This result was even better than the first experiment above. As the exponential moving averages give greater weight to the more recent price moves, they are able to react to the dynamics of closer trends more swiftly than the historically further-away trends, compared to the Simple Moving Averages which give equal weights to price moves in different distances of times. Applying Exponential moving averages might be even more appropriate here. Interestingly, also notice from the report graph of this strategy that under this usage of exponential moving averages instead of simple moving averages here, the frequency of (buy & sell) transactions seemed even lower than that in the previous scenarios, indicating that indeed, through avoiding too frequent trades sometimes could improve our performance.<br>\n",
    "There's one potential conclusion we may draw from our experiments here that shorter-term moving averages tend to be less effective than longer-term moving averages, which increase the robustness of the strategy and prevent obsessively frequent trades that might lead to further loss.<br>\n",

    "This updated double SMA crossover strategy (fast SMA period - 10, slow SMA period - 50, as following the previous two experiments) with additional checking mechanism of \"real\" or \"fake\" Golden Cross (Buy signal) and Death Cross (Exit signal) improves our final trading results compared to the original DoubleSMACrossover again. Though earning a little bit less than the previous second strategy using exponential moving averages, it still gives us a quite decent final value of \\$12007.22 (~20% return from the \\$10000 original money available in the beginning), earning \\$2005.91 more than the original DoubleSMACrossover strategy. Many may take any \"crossover\" of the two moving average lines as signals; however, this is not the case all the time. Besides the normal \"crossover\" occurrences we normally regard as signals, we often need to take into consideration whether the longer term trend is truly rising or declining as well. Say, if a golden cross appears (fast SMA crosses slow SMA from below to above) but actually the longer term still is indicating a bearish (downward) trend as shown by the slow SMA, the market dynamic is actually not prospering enough to provide sufficient evidence for justifying a BUY order decision; thus, this situation is actually considered a \"false signal\" of golden cross. (similar for the \"fake\" death cross scenario as reversal signal.) This updated strategy now enables us to sidestep those \"fake signals\" and avoid making mistakes trading at false timings.<br>\n",
